            "Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a physicist and chemist known for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She discovered the elements polonium and radium, developed techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. Her work revolutionized science and medicine, leading to advancements in radiation therapy. Despite facing challenges as a woman in science, she persevered and made lasting contributions, though prolonged exposure to radiation led to her death. Her legacy continues to inspire scientists worldwide.
